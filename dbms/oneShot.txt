DBMS ONE SHOT :-

- INTRODUCTION TO DBMS
- Database management systems 
- Data is a collection of raw , unorganised facts and details like text .
- Data can be recorded and doesen't have any meaning unless processed .
- Data can be quantitative like age , cost of item and qualitative like name , gender , colour .
- Information is processed , organised and structured data . 
- Data is a collection of facts while information puts those facts into context .
- Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed , managed and updated .
- To make real use of data we need the database management systems .
- Database management system is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data .
- The primary goal of a dbms is to provide a way to store and retrive the database information that is both convenient and efficient .
- Dbms is database itself along with all the software and functionality .
- It is used to perform the operations like addition , retrival , updation and deletion of the data .
- Filesystem is also a way to store the data but have major disadvantage over dbms .
- Those disadvantages are - data redundancy and consistency , difficulty in accessing data , integrity problems , atomicity problems , concurrent-access anomalies and security problems .
- Above are also the advantages of dbms .

- DBMS ARCHITECTURE
- Dbms architecture is a 3 schema architecture also known as view of the data .
- It provides abstract view of data which hides how data is stored .
- Major objective is to provide personalized view to the multiple users .
- Three levels are physical , logical and external or view level/schema .
- Physical level is the lowest level of abstraction like how data is stored , storage structures , data structure likle n-array tree etc , encryption , security algorithms.
- Logical/conceptual level defines the design of the db , describes what data and what relationships among data , dba operate the logical level .
- View level is the highest level which simplifies the user interaction , different view to different end user , also provide security mechanisms to prevent access .
- The collection of information stored at a particular moment is called the instance of db .
- Overall design is DB schema , a structural description .
- Logical schema is most important .
- Data models provide a way to design db like er model , relationship model , object oriented model , object relationship model etc .
- Db languages are ddl , dml etc 
- DDL data definition language is used to specify database schema .
- DML data manipulation language is used express data queries and updates like retrival , deletion , insertion and updation .
- Applications use a layer to interact with the db like a host language sql .
- Dba is db administrator who control the data and programs which access data . 
- Task of dba include - schema definition , storate and access modification , routine checkups , security patche and updates .
- Dbms application arhitecture include a client machine which remotly use db and server machine on which db runs .
- Dbms application architecture include three architectures t1 t2 t3 .
- T1 architecture is when client , server and db all present in the same machine .
- T2 architecture is when app is partitioned in 2 components client and server/db , client access data by queries and api's .
- T3 architecture is when app is partitioned in 3 component client , application server , db , client sent the request to app server and app server intract with db which increase security  , scalability etc . 
- T3 architecture advantages are scalability , data integrity and security .
